## Ciao ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tuan (pronounced 'Twan'), also known as Conrad. I'm a curious software
engineer who always strive for the best possible way of solving problems.

I've worked with many programming languages before and absolutely
appreciated them by the way that they taught me seeing things from
different angles and perspectives. I enjoy speaking about this and showing
people how to use these techniques to level up their skills. It's
incredible to me that you can open a computer and learn about anything
at your fingertips!

I'm firmly believe that in order to understand, explore and further in
any field, one needs to be equipped with diverse knowledge, which having
a deep, but not too narrow understanding in order to not limiting
themselves from discovering to the great creations.

I've been fortunate to work with some multinational corporations with
diverse cultures and had wonderful time there.

I make "things" or hack on various other projects on the side when I get
the time. All whilst improving my design mindsets and well-structured
code. 

Donâ€™t be shy, just say "Hi!". I canâ€™t wait to chat with you! ðŸ˜„

Like always, stay awesome!
