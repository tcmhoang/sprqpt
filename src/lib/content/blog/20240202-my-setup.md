{% overview %}
this is my first blog and it's the overall introduction message
{% /overview %}

## Hardware
{% /permalink %}

- Only thing I have is a laptop => portable, easy to carry around ->
  move around alot -> deos not settle in one place 
- 2 models from dell xps 9570 -> 5 years, from uni days
- 9520 -> now still happy with this , good performance but nvidia makes
  the battery worst => but still use it 
- Give them the specs

## Software
{% /permalink %}
- Nvim as my main editor => approx 2 years using those => Vim morions is
  cool
- Distro -> Opensuse -> solid (yast brtfs) never break, can roll back
  has shf system => not like nix => enable require only in zypper
  - also dua boot windows => can use office or play games on steam => 2
    main purposes.
- Do modify some configuration to make it run better on this laptop
  - some prob with nix => not sure want to delve inro
  - still can use the power of nix to maintain the stable in the distro
    (unstable)
 - support kde is top notch => kde connect is the must if u use android
- leverage the traditional dot file using tuckr 
 - still need to figure out how to add nix pkgs and home-manager to
   tuckr => nix first or tucker or maybe the otherway around

   list some of the tool often use

- lay all the software written in rust on top of current systen => w/o
  braking like coreutils 

- because of nvidia => stick to x not switch to wayland
also best touch pad gesure => fusuma
