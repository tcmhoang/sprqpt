## Ciao ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tuan (pronounced 'Twan'), also known as Conrad. I'm a curious software
engineer who always strives for the best possible way of solving problems.

I've worked with many programming languages before and absolutely
appreciated the way that they taught me seeing things from
different angles and perspectives. I enjoy speaking about this and showing
people how to use these techniques to level up their skills. It's
incredible to me that you can open a computer and learn about anything
at your fingertips!

I firmly believe that in order to understand, explore and further in
any field, one needs to be equipped with diverse knowledge, which has
a deep, but not too narrow understanding to not limiting
themselves from discovering to the great creations.

I make "things" and hack on various other projects on the side when I get
the time. All whilst improving my design mindsets and well-structured
code. 

Donâ€™t be shy, just say "Hi!". I canâ€™t wait to chat with you! ðŸ˜„

Like always, stay awesome!
