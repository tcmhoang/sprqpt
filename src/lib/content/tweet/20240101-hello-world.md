Happy new year y'all.

What's the wish you have for the new year?

I launched this website on the very first day of 2024 to keep one of my
last year's resolutions. So guess what? Here I am. The very first website I
build for my own. This place is where I try to post about what I'm up to
every now and then with various kinds of topics like coding, tech, or
food? Idk. The website is still under construction. New features are
coming. If something sparks for interest, don't be hesitant to subscribe to my
RSS (when I finish implementing it) ðŸ¤­. Hopefully, I can get it running
with all of my desired features before the lunar new year.
