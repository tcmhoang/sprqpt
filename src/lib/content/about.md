## Ciao üëã

I'm Conrad, also known as Tuan
_(but hey, Twan works too, no sweat! Call me whichever floats your boat! )_.
I'm an uber-curious Software Engineer who always strives for the best
possible way of solving problems.

I've worked with many programming languages before. Each one has taught
me to see things through a new perspective, all the while gaining a
treasure trove of new concepts. I enjoy speaking about them and sharing
these techniques with other people to level up their skills. It's
incredible to me that you can just open a computer and learn basically
about anything at your fingertips.

I firmly believe that in order to understand, explore, and further in
any field, one needs to be equipped with diverse knowledge, which has a
deep, but not too narrow understanding to not limit oneself from
discovering the great creations. That's why I'm all about getting my
hands dirty in every corner of the CS, constantly expanding my skill set.
My ultimate goal is to find a place where I can utilize and continue to
expand my knowledge. To me, problem-solving isn't limited by languages
or paradigms but fuels pure innovation for the future. That means using
computers in ways we can't even imagine yet! Like, imagine being a master
carpenter who can build anything from a toothpick tower to a spaceship,
just by grabbing the right tool. That's the kind of developer I wanna be!

When I have free time, I like to build cool stuff and tinker with side
projects
_(Gotta keep that design mindset on point and that coding skills sharp)_.
So don't be a stranger! Hit me up with a "Hi!" and let's have a
chat about all things such as tech, banh mi, or whatever you have in mind.

**Stay curious, stay awesome, and keep coding like nobody's watching! ‚úåÔ∏è**
